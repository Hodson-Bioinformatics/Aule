## [1.0] - 2024-11-20

This release was authored by Joanna A. Krupka.

This module creates a custom panel of normals for use in the ichorCNA workflow. The main script used is createPanelOfNormals.R and it is provided by the ichorCNA package. The logic of how this module handles inputs and file conversions closely follows that of the ichorcna module aside from this main step.
