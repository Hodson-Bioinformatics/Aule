## [1.0] - 2024-12-27

This release was authored by Joanna A. Krupka.

This module creates a phased variant panel of normals for use in the main phased variant workflow in aule_pv. The main script used for this purpose is PV_pon.R. The logic of how this module handles phased variant identification, annotation, and filtering closely follows that of the aule_pv module and is documented there.
