**Aule** (Automated Ultrasensitive Lymphoma Evaluation) is a pipeline performing end-to-end analysis of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in patients with Large B-cell Lymphoma (LBCL). 
AULE has a modular architecture following the framework of the [LCR pipeline](https://lcr-modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), developed by Prof. Ryan Morin's lab. AULE can be used as a comprehensive standalone software package or integrated as an add-on to an existing LCR pipeline.

## üî¨ Background

Recent studies have generated considerable interest in the potential of ctDNA to transform cancer treatment and facilitate precision medicine trials with treatments tailored to individual risk profiles and biological subtypes. However, the majority of current ctDNA analysis platforms are proprietary "black-box" assays that offer limited opportunities for customisation, further development, and rigorous validation. To address these limitations, we have developed a comprehensive open-source pipeline that renders ctDNA analysis both accessible and cost-effective for research.
